In this hypothetical case, our six-person team is actively developing a PHP-based application using the Yii2 framework on top of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). To ensure smooth and reliable development and deployment, we’ve set up a CI/CD pipeline that includes linting, testing, and building.

For **linting**, we use PHP_CodeSniffer to enforce coding standards and catch syntax issues early. It helps keep the code clean and consistent across contributors. For **testing**, Yii2 integrates well with Codeception and PHPUnit, both of which support unit and functional testing. These frameworks are easy to integrate into CI tools and help ensure application quality with every change.

While Jenkins and GitHub Actions are widely used, there are other options like GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and Bitbucket Pipelines. In our case, we use **GitHub Actions** because it integrates tightly with our GitHub repository and supports automation for every pull request.

For **building**, although PHP is not compiled, our pipeline includes preparing a clean production-ready package. This typically involves running `composer install --no-dev`, optimizing autoloaders, and zipping the application directory for deployment. In some setups, we also build a Docker image to ensure consistency across environments.

We prefer a **cloud-based CI/CD setup**, as it reduces maintenance and scales easily. However, if we handled sensitive customer data or had strict security constraints, a self-hosted solution could be considered. The final decision would depend on cost, compliance needs, and operational complexity.123
